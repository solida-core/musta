## INSTRUCTIONS
Create a virtual environment with the command:
```commandline
mamba create -c bioconda -c conda-forge --name snakemake snakemake=6.15 snakedeploy
```
and activate it:
```commandline
conda activate snakemake
```
We get some public data to test the pipeline. You can directly clone in this folder from github, just type:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/solida-core/test-data-somatic.git
```
You can then perform the pipeline deploy defining a directory `my_dest_dir` for analysis output and a pipeline tag for a specific version:
```bash
snakedeploy deploy-workflow https://github.com/solida-core/musta 
                    my_desd_dir 
                    --tag v1.1
```
To run the pipeline, go inside the deployed pipeline folder and use the command:
```bash
snakemake --use-conda -p --cores all
```
You can generate analysis report with the command:
```bash
snakemake --report report.zip --cores all
```
