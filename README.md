## TEMP INSTRUCITONS
Create a virtual environment with the command:
```commandline
mamba create -c bioconda -c conda-forge --name snakemake snakemake=6.15
```
and activate it:
```commandline
conda activate snakemake
```
We get some public data to test the pipeline. You can directly clone in this folder from github, just type:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/solida-core/test-data-somatic.git
```
You can then perform a dry-run defining a directory for analysis output with the `-d` parameter:
```commandline
snakemake -n --use-conda -p --cores all -d workdir
```
